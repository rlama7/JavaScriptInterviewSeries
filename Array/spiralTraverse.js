/**
 * spiralTraverse.js    - A program to find the spiral array from a n x m two-dimensional array.
 * @author              - Ratna Lama
 * @version             - 1.0.0
 * @description         - Spiral order starts from the tope left corner fo the two-d array,
 *                        goes to the right, and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way
 *                        until every element has been visited.
 *
 * Example -
 *      INPUT:
 *          array = [
 *                      [10, 20, 30],
 *                      [40, 50, 60],
 *                      [70, 80, 90],
 *                  ]
 *      OUTPUT:
 *          array = [10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 80, 70, 40, 50]
 *
 * Algorithm -
 *
 *
 * Time Complexity: O() -->
 * Space Complexity: O() -->
